3. Even if server side program, these statements are applied;i.e. if this code 
   is used for server side web application, this copyright notice and realted 
   statments should be generated.
4. If top-line of a user of this framework, regardless of who is an individual 
   or some kind of organization, is higher than 10,000,000 yen / year, a user 
   should pay for this framework as license fee. License fee is yearly 
   subscription bases. Fee will be negotiated with license owner but it would
   be around 300,000 to 10,000,000 yen / year for small to middle size company.
   If a user is a big size company, a fee should be higher than 10,000,000 
   yen / year and the rest is negotiation bases based on their top-line and 
   operation profit.
5. If a company, person or group donate money to NMD Soft for this software, 
   fee defined above for this software will be exempted. For example, amount of 
   donation could be 10,000JPY/year to 1,000,000 JPY/year. Or no donation is required 
   if one's topline is less than 10mil JPY / year. Donation will be used to cost of 
   developmement. We live in home, we use watar/gas/elec, we eat something,
   we do some hobby. Money is important to spend life and continuous R&D is far
   more important. If my income is stable, development of this software is also
   stable. Not so huge money is requred. 5mil to 10mil would be enough choice for
   base and expense. Now, a user company can use this software completly free
   of charge expect donation. This software is a public base. Although this is
   BSD license bases, as GNU manifest said, it is assumed to do competition over
   the same software base. Let's make a public base by everyone who has intrests.
   Base is made by everyone but moderate monetize or donation are required.
   See https://www.khj1977.net/profile/misc/web-and-econ.html 
   for this argument in Japanese. This is a experiment of old good communism wth modern 
   IT industry.
